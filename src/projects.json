"description":"The project aimed to dehaze remote sensing images by employing the Dark Channel Prior (DCP) technique, transforming hazy images into vibrant, saturated representations. Additionally, the objective included quantifying the amount of haze present in the original images By introducing random masks to simulate various atmospheric conditions, the project successfully applied the Dehazing algorithm based on Dark Channel Prior to enhance remote sensing images. The dehazed images were then quantified by measuring the Euclidean distance, providing a clear metric for the amount of haze removed.",
